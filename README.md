# RoboRig: A 2R Manipulator Simulation
## Overview
RoboRig is a 2R manipulator designed for versatility and efficiency. This repository contains a Python codebase for simulating RoboRig's motion control, trajectory planning, and optimization schemes. With its trusty revolute joints, RoboRig embarks on a quest to conquer challenges with the guidance of its human companions.

## Features
Trajectory Planning: Generate trajectories for RoboRig to follow, including circular paths and custom paths.
Motion Control: Implement feedforward and feedback control to ensure smooth motion and trajectory tracking.
Optimization: Resolve redundancy in the manipulator by minimizing kinetic energy using optimization schemes.
Simulation: Visualize RoboRig's motion in 2D space with matplotlib animations.
## Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
SciPy
Matplotlib
## Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
